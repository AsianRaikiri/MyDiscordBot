# MyDiscordBot

My First Discord Bot, using a few different Tutorials of [CodeLyon](https://youtu.be/j_sD9udZnCk) and [Fusion Terror](https://www.youtube.com/FusionTerror) to get started with this.
It is important to note, that since Discord is in V13, a few of the older Tutorials do not work anymore as intended, since many
basic functions were changed in the way that they have to be called. E.g. ".send(embed)" is now ".send({embeds: [embed]}), 
since Discord now allows multiple embeds in one message. 


This is to explore the endless possibilities a Bot has and get over my compulsive need to start a new project every week lel.
